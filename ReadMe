# Videogame LDA Analysis

This repository contains scripts and data for topic modeling and analysis of videogame comments using LDA.

## Structure

- **data/raw/** — Raw `.parquet` comment data for each game
- **data/processed/** — (Optional) Intermediate files (currently empty)
- **data/final/** — Final outputs: cleaned data, dictionaries, models, and CSVs (created by scripts)
- **scripts/** — Jupyter notebooks for POS-aware cleaning, LDA training, and analysis

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cbisbee126/vg_lda.git
   cd vg_lda
   ```

2. Install needed libraries manually: pandas, gensim, nltk, matplotlib._

3. Run notebooks in the `scripts/` folder.  
   Outputs will be saved to `data/final/`.

## Notes

- Empty folders (`processed`, `final`) may not appear until outputs are generated, unless a `.gitkeep` is present.
- All paths are **relative** for smooth collaboration.
- For NLTK, some resources will be downloaded at runtime.
